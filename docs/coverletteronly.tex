  I am writing this in reference to your job posting of Jr. Diagnostic Specialist. I have a background in physics working in infrared molecular spectroscopy and bitumen upgrading, but I have had long-time aspirations of contributing to the future of fusion energy.

In my work as a summer student  I developed portions of code for a diagnostic system used for infrared molecular spectroscopy as well as contributed to the design and mainenance (such as alignment and calibration) of several optical experimental apparatuses. In this time I developed a familiarity with lasers, optics, electronics, spectroscopy, and high vacuum, as well as gained programming skill in MATLAB, and python. Also worth mentioning is that in school I built a Michelson interferometer.

I would like to speak briefly about the soft-skills I learned in my previous job. The goal of this project was to develop and characterize a novel method of upgrading bitumen. Since I was the only person devoted full-time to this project, I had a large deal of creative input and responsibility and worked with a high degree of autonomy. Notably, I documented the entire experiment and presented results frequently. My experience in this pivotal role translates to good initiative and a high ability to work independently in future positions.

To summarize, my combination of experiences and the skills I learned in them are a very good match for this position. My CV is attached in this application and on my CV you can find a link to my personal website. I hope you will consider both and contact me regarding this job posting.
