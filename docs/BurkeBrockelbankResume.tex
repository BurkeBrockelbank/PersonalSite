I am glad to apply for this position as a research technician at D-Wave. I first heard about D-Wave in a talk by a guest speaker, Dr. Alexandre Blais, at the University of Calgary. Later, in conversation with an old professor of mine, Dr. Paul Barclay, he suggested I should look for work with D-Wave. You can imagine my excitement at seeing an open position.

In my current position as a research assistant, I design and interpret experiments on upgrading bitumen, but concurrently work in a support role in molecular spectroscopy. I regularly work with cryogenic temperatures as well as testing and repairing simple electronic components. I also work on software that automates some lab processes. This experience makes me very well suited to this position. I understand that there will be much to learn, but I am very interested in understanding the project both on a large scale and in detail.

%I am glad to apply for this position as Data Analyst. I have recently graduated from a BSc in physics and I am very interested into applying the practices I learned in a non-academic setting.

%I understand that this position requires a top student with great mathematical skills. Programming skills are definitely an asset in a data analyst position. I can assure you that I graduated in the top of my class with a GPA of 3.9. I also excelled in all of my math courses and have skills in calculus, linear algebra, and analysis, as well as more applied areas of math such as convex optimization. Finally, I have always had a passion for developing code. My programming language of choice is Python, but I am familiar with several. I like Python because it is useful for quickly writing scripts that increase workflow efficiency.

I look forward to hearing more about the details of this project and where I would fit in!
