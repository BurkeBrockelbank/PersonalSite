\section{Research Experience}
%\subsection{Physics}
\cventry{2017-2018}{Research Assistant}{Nasser Moazzen-Ahmadi}{Calgary}{University of Calgary}{\textbf{Investigating the feasibility of upgrading of bitumen with lasers.}\\%
One of the products from Alberta's oil sands is bitumen, a extremely viscous hydrocarbon source with heavy, branching organic compounds. In this state it is not usable for fuel, and is difficult to transport. There are many methods of upgrading bitumen into crude oil, a lighter hydrocarbon that is more easily transported and later refined into petroleum products like gasoline. In this project, I lead the development of a novel technique for upgrading bitumen using lasers.
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Apparatus design} of three separate vacuum cell irradiation chambers and a rotating mount to improve upgrading efficiency by an order of magnitude.
  \item
    \textbf{Experimental planning} for chemical characterization with NMR and GCMS to definitively show upgrading.
  \item
    \textbf{Organization} of progress and planning into multimedia log, reports, and presentations to communicate with collaborators and funders.
\end{itemize}}
%\subsection{Physics}
\cventry{2016-2017}{Thesis}{Gilad Gour}{Calgary}{University of Calgary}{\textbf{Maximally entangled multipartite symmetric states}\\
Symmetric states, where exchanging particles leads to no change in the total state are prevalent in nature e.g. identical bosons. In this project I investigated maximal entanglement in these systems.
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Conducted literature review} to learn about the history and current state of the field.
  \item
    \textbf{Goal planning} kept the project concise and focused, increasing efficiency.
  \item
    \textbf{Researched numerical tools} used to develop intuition for project.
  \item
    \textbf{Developed theoretical solution} by writing a visualization program in python. This visualization allowed solutions to be guessed just by looking at a chart.
\end{itemize}}
\cventry{2015--2017}{Summer Researcher}{Nasser Moazzen-Ahmadi}{Calgary}{University of Calgary}{\textbf{Study of infrared (IR) rovibrational spectroscopy of molecular clusters.}\\%
Molecular clusters were formed in vacuum with a supersonic slit-jet. Clusters were probed with a continuous wave laser (QCL and OPO) scanned at high resolution to obtain rotational spectra.\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Automated} parts of the data calibration process, leading to nearly a doubling of the speed for calibration.
  \item
    \textbf{Improved} the software design of the LabVIEW program to be more encapsulated and extensible for future development.
  \item
    \textbf{Communicated} with the scientific community in several poster presentations (PHAS Symposim 2017, Undergraduate Research Night 2016, Quantum Alberta Workshop 2016) and one publication ( Three new infrared bands of the He-OCS complex, 2017)
  \item
    \textbf{Conducted annual safety inspection} to evaluate the state of the lab, leading to several corrections of errors in previous reports.
\end{itemize}

I am glad to apply for this position as a research technician at D-Wave. I first heard about D-Wave in a talk by a guest speaker, Dr. Alexandre Blais, at the University of Calgary. Later, in conversation with an old professor of mine, Dr. Paul Barclay, he suggested I should look for work with D-Wave. You can imagine my excitement at seeing an open position.

In my current position as a research assistant, I design and interpret experiments on upgrading bitumen, but concurrently work in a support role in molecular spectroscopy. I regularly work with cryogenic temperatures as well as testing and repairing simple electronic components. I also work on software that automates some lab processes. This experience makes me very well suited to this position. I understand that there will be much to learn, but I am very interested in understanding the project both on a large scale and in detail.

%I am glad to apply for this position as Data Analyst. I have recently graduated from a BSc in physics and I am very interested into applying the practices I learned in a non-academic setting.

%I understand that this position requires a top student with great mathematical skills. Programming skills are definitely an asset in a data analyst position. I can assure you that I graduated in the top of my class with a GPA of 3.9. I also excelled in all of my math courses and have skills in calculus, linear algebra, and analysis, as well as more applied areas of math such as convex optimization. Finally, I have always had a passion for developing code. My programming language of choice is Python, but I am familiar with several. I like Python because it is useful for quickly writing scripts that increase workflow efficiency.

I look forward to hearing more about the details of this project and where I would fit in!
